## Title of the Project
## AI-Based Predictive Maintenance System for Software Systems

## About
This project is an AI-powered predictive maintenance system designed to monitor software systems and predict potential failures before they occur. It analyzes system logs and performance metrics using machine learning techniques to reduce downtime and improve system reliability.


## Features

- Proactive Failure Prediction: Predicts software faults and performance degradation before system breakdowns occur.
- AI-Driven Anomaly Detection: Uses machine learning to identify abnormal behavior in logs and performance metrics.
- Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously tracks system health across applications, servers, and cloud services.
- Intelligent Alerting System: Generates early warnings with actionable maintenance recommendations.
- Adaptive Learning: Continuously improves prediction accuracy by learning from new system data.
- Visualization Dashboard: Provides clear insights into system performance trends and anomalies.
- Scalability & Integration: Supports cloud, microservices, and enterprise environments with API integration.
